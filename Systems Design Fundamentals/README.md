## Systems Design Fundamentals
> Where the Coding Interview serves primarily as an assessment of your problem-solving ability, the Systems Design interview is a test of your engineering knowledge veiled behind the facade of an open-ended design question.

### 1. Design Fundamentals - Introduction
>* Coding Interviews tests a Software Engineer's ability to solve a problem.
>* They focus **less** on theoritical knowledge and **more** on problem solving ability.
>* Overall, if a coding interview problem is given to someone who has no coding background, no computer science background, they would likely be able to tackle the problem at least a little bit.
>* They wouldn't be able to know that they have to use a certain data structure to solve a problem optimally. But they would be able to conceptually tackle the problem. 

>* With Systems Design interviews on the other hand, that would not be possible.
>* If someone with no software engineeering background is given a canonical Systems Design interview question like design Youtube, design a website where millions of people can upload video content and billions of people can view that content and comment on it, like it, that person would not be able to answer this question properly.
>* Because Systems Design interviews really do require a lot of **knowledge** about Systems, about how to build Robust, Functional, and Scalable Systems.
>* That's where Design Fundamentals come into play.
>* **Design Fundamentals** are the **foundational knowledge** that is needed for **Systems Design interviews** just as Data Structures are the foundational knowledge that is needed for Coding Interviews.
>* Design Fundamentals are absolutely necessary. Without them one cannot tackle a Systems Design interview question.

>* There are lot of Design Fundamentals to know such as System, Availability, Database, Load Balancer, Cache, HTTP etc.
