## Systems Design Fundamentals
> Where the Coding Interview serves primarily as an assessment of your problem-solving ability, the Systems Design interview is a test of your engineering knowledge veiled behind the facade of an open-ended design question.

### 1. Design Fundamentals - Introduction
>* Coding Interviews tests a Software Engineer's ability to solve a problem.
>* They focus **less** on theoritical knowledge and **more** on problem solving ability.
>* Overall, if a coding interview problem is given to someone who has no coding background, no computer science background, they would likely be able to tackle the problem at least a little bit.
>* They wouldn't be able to know that they have to use a certain data structure to solve a problem optimally. But they would be able to conceptually tackle the problem. 

>* With Systems Design interviews on the other hand, that would not be possible.
>* If someone with no software engineeering background is given a canonical Systems Design interview question like design Youtube, design a website where millions of people can upload video content and billions of people can view that content and comment on it, like it, that person would not be able to answer this question properly.
>* Because Systems Design interviews really do require a lot of **knowledge** about Systems, about how to build Robust, Functional, and Scalable Systems.
>* That's where Design Fundamentals come into play.
>* **Design Fundamentals** are the **foundational knowledge** that is needed for **Systems Design interviews** just as Data Structures are the foundational knowledge that is needed for Coding Interviews.
>* Design Fundamentals are absolutely necessary. Without them one cannot tackle a Systems Design interview question.

>* There are lot of Design Fundamentals to know such as System, Availability, Database, Load Balancer, Cache, HTTP etc.

### 2. What Are Design Fundamentals?
>* Building scalable, production-ready applications is both art and science. Science, in that it requires **knowledge of many topics** in computer engineering; art, in that it demands an **eye for making smart design choices and piecing together** the right technologies.
>* Master both disciplines and you, too, can become a **Systems Expert**.

#### How Systems Design interviews actually work?
>* Systems Design interview questions are very **intentionally vague**.
>* They can **often be stated in just a few words** like **design Uber** or **design Facebook Messenger**, **design Youtube**.
>* And it is the **responsibility of the interviewee** to be able to take a two-word sentence, like design Uber and **turn it into a 45-minute discussion**.
>* So naturally that's gonna involve asking your interviewer questions, prodding them about what type of system you're building, what kind of functionality the system is gonna have to support, what characteristics we're gonna value in the system.
>* This type of **investigation** in a Systems Design interview is gonna **require a lot of fundamental Systems Design knowledge**.

>* Now the second thing that's important to note about Systems Design interviews is that, unlike with coding interviews, where a solution to coding interview question is either objectively correct or incorrect.
>* With Systems Design interview questions, there's a lot more subjectivity.
>* A proposed solution to a Systems Design interview question may very well not be objectively correct or objectively incorrect.
>* There might be certain concepts in Systems Design that could be used objectively incorrectly, if misinformed or if one doesn't have appropriate knowledge.
>* But, if you have the appropriate knowledge, if you are well informed, if you are prepared, then a suggested solution to a Systems Design interview question is not gonna be objectively correct or incorrect.
>* It's gonna be your job to very confidently justify your solution.
>* It's gonna be your job to explain, to rationalize why you've made certain choices, why you've designed parts of your system in one way instead of another.
>* It's gonna be your job to make your interviewer understand 
why your proposed solution is reasonable, why it's sound, and why it might be the best one. Or perhaps why it might not be the best one, why it might be one of many potential solutions.
>* It's gonna be your job to eliminate any doubts that your interviewer might have in some of your design choices.
>* It's gonna be your job to defend your position, or to adapt your position if your interviewer challenges it.
>* This is gonna be nearly impossible to do without the proper fundamental knowledge about Systems Design.
>* That's why Design Fundamentals are so critical to Systems Design interviews.

##### Categories of Systems Design
>* Design Fundamentals come in a lot of different flavors.
>* More specifically, they can be bucketed in 4 broad categories, categories that are equally important, categories that are very much intertwined, and categories that kind of build upon each other.

###### 1st Category
>* The 1st category of design fundamentals is the underlying or the foundational knowledge.
>* These are gonna be design fundamentals where, if you don't understand them, you will at best have severe gaps in knowledge that will undermine your positions or your ability to defend your positions in a Systems Design interview and that will, at worst, make you basically incapable of even beginning to tackle a Systems Design interview.

>* For example, you have to know what the client server model is to be able to design any modern day system.
>* Things like network protocols. You have to have some understanding of how machines communicate and interact with one another in order to be able to properly design a complex system.

> So that is the 1st category of Design Fundamentals, foundational Systems Design knowledge.
